# Active Directory Lab

## Objective

This lab aims to create an ADDC (Active Directory Domain Controller) automation lab within a SOC (Security Operations Center) automation framework. It is designed to enhance the detection, analysis, and response capabilities of security teams. By leveraging tools such as Splunk, Atomic Red Team, and Crowbar for brute forcing, the lab can simulate realistic attack scenarios and automate responses, thereby improving overall security posture. This approach enhances detection capabilities, improves response times, and promotes continuous security improvement. Integrating these tools into a cohesive automation framework, the ADDC automation lab provides a robust platform for advancing the security operations of an organization.

### Skills Learned

- Log Management and Analysis: Proficient in using Splunk to collect, index, and analyze machine data from various sources, including Windows Event Logs, Active Directory logs, and network traffic.
- Security Monitoring: Experienced in setting up Splunk dashboards, alerts, and reports to monitor for suspicious activities and potential security incidents.
- Automation and Orchestration: Skilled in integrating Splunk with other security tools to automate responses to detected threats.
- Adversary Emulation: Capable of using Atomic Red Team to simulate adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- Testing and Validation: Competent in validating the effectiveness of security controls and detection capabilities against known attack methods using Atomic Red Team.
- Continuous Improvement: Adept at identifying and addressing gaps in detection and response capabilities to continuously improve security measures.
- Brute Forcing Techniques: Proficient in using Crowbar to perform brute force attacks against various services (RDP, SSH, VNC) to test system resilience.
- Credential Testing: Experienced in testing the robustness of login credentials and identifying weak or compromised credentials with Crowbar.
- Integration with Automation: Skilled in integrating Crowbar into automated testing workflows to regularly check for vulnerabilities.
- Environment Setup: Capable of deploying an Active Directory Domain Controller and configuring a network of Windows clients and servers, as well as configuring Splunk to collect and analyze logs.
- Simulating Attacks: Experienced in executing scripted attack simulations using Atomic Red Team to mimic real-world adversary behaviors and performing brute force attacks with Crowbar.
- Monitoring and Response: Proficient in configuring Splunk to detect simulated attack activities, generate alerts, and automate response actions such as isolating compromised systems, resetting passwords, and notifying security personnel.
- Review and Improvement: Skilled in analyzing the results of simulated attacks and automated responses, identifying detection gaps or weaknesses, and updating detection rules, response playbooks, and security controls.
- Enhanced Detection Capabilities: Experienced in regularly testing to ensure the SOC can detect a wide range of attack techniques.
- Improved Response Times: Proficient in automating incident response to reduce the time to respond to incidents and minimize potential damage.
- Continuous Security Improvement: Competent in conducting ongoing testing and analysis to identify and remediate security gaps, leading to a more resilient security posture.
