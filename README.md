# Active Directory Lab

## Objective

This lab aims to create an ADDC (Active Directory Domain Controller) automation lab within a SOC (Security Operations Center) automation framework. It is designed to enhance the detection, analysis, and response capabilities of security teams. By leveraging tools such as Splunk, Atomic Red Team, and Crowbar for brute forcing, the lab can simulate realistic attack scenarios and automate responses, thereby improving overall security posture. This approach enhances detection capabilities, improves response times, and promotes continuous security improvement. Integrating these tools into a cohesive automation framework, the ADDC automation lab provides a robust platform for advancing the security operations of an organization.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Splunk is an open-source security monitoring platform used for threat detection.
- TheHive is an open-source incident response platform that helps security teams manage and investigate security incidents
- Shuffle: A general purpose security automation platform
